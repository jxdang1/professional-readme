# readme-generator

## Description

The purpose of this project is to create a professional README file using markdown. Using inquirer to retrieve data from the user, they will be asked a series of prompt which leads to a README file that includes a table of content with installation, usage, credits, license, etc. 

## Installation

Node installation will be required in order to run this in your integrated terminal. After you have cloned the repo, you will run 'npm install' to install necessary dependencies. 

## Usage

In your terminal, run 'node index.js' and answer the prompts. Once you have answered the prompts, a file will be created in the "example" folder. This will be your new generated README file. If you do not answer the prompt or accidentally click enter, you will be prompted "Please enter an answer." to answer the prompts stated.
